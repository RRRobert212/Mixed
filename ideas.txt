on the bottom of the screen display the current order of the phrase based on the position of the words. It updates when users move the words around.
There is also a submit button so users will be able to read their completed phrase and ensure it's right before they hit submit.

BTW, I think this game might be pretty easy so I think we make them go for 100% completion and score based on time, add time penalty for wrong submission.

Divide it into lines where it goes left to right unless you put a word on a new line 
and lines are defined as like starting below the bottom of the topmost word on the above line

local order correct - turns yellow. i.e. if a word to the right or left of a word is correct then both of those get highlighted. a string in between them perhaps.

pulse for lock animation. is pulse a buult in effect? or do we just use scale?


make the end CELEBRATION more exciting - also for the slow people or tired (me)give them a word aleady or hint the fast ones don't need it 

Problem with local highlighting, 'with a busted face I arrive like a fairy' VS 'I arrive like a fairy with a busted face' one of them gets 
highlighted all yellow so it like seems like it's in the right order, but there is a break. Problem due to both bwords being highlighted when local order is correct.

BADGES: if the words are too thin the badges don't work. Also if the the badge is too wide I think on a small word, then it get's displayed like vertically. 
Also badges don't persist after moving.

ARROWS: arrows are a little weird with repeated words but I don't know if this is really fixable. Not a pressing issue.

CELEBRATION: needs info on the quote. Author and year ( or century?) if possible. Building actual dataset of quotes tied to this info is a big task.

change bottom away from timer and into number of guesses.

Hard mode - no punctuation? Extremely hard mode - no punctuation no feedback or no feedback except green? or just no feedback but yes punctuation?
